# NumPy Compatibility Notice

## Important Update

This guide is no longer relevant as the compatibility issue has been resolved.

## Current Status

The latest version of `sentence-transformers` now fully supports NumPy 2.x. There is no longer any need to downgrade NumPy or perform special installation steps.

If you previously saw an error like this:
```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.2.6 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
```

This error should no longer occur with the latest versions.

## What Changed

- **sentence-transformers** has been updated to support NumPy 2.x API
- The restrictions on NumPy versions have been removed from requirements.txt
- The fix_numpy_compatibility.bat script is no longer needed
- All compatibility warnings have been removed from the codebase

## Recommended Actions

If you are updating from an older version:

1. **Update your packages**:
   ```batch
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the normal diagnostic tool if needed**:
   ```batch
   diagnose_and_fix.bat
   ```

## Verification

To verify everything is working correctly:
```batch
python -c "import numpy; print(f'NumPy version: {numpy.__version__}')"
python -c "import sentence_transformers; print('Success!')"
```

## Technical Details

- **Compatible NumPy versions**: All versions 1.21.0 and above (including 2.x)
- **sentence-transformers version**: 2.2.2 or higher
- **Python requirement**: 3.8 or higher
