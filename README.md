# 🚀 Obsidian-Milvus-FastMCP

**A powerful, production-ready system that connects your Obsidian vault to Claude Desktop via FastMCP, leveraging Milvus vector database for intelligent document search and retrieval.** 

**This program is useful for people who store extensive Markdown and PDF materials in Obsidian and need to extract comprehensive information from Obsidian for research, work, and study purposes.**

**Warning! This program is extremely heavy and requires high memory (RAM) usage due to the need to keep the Milvus server running constantly, even when not performing embedding tasks. Therefore, it is not suitable for PCs with limited memory or laptops where power consumption needs to be conserved. Additionally, this program only supports Windows 10 and 11.**

- **Obsidian vault** with markdown files

## 🔧 Installation
### Recommended Installation

1. Make sure git is installed

2. Download an installer from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/l4qtgiuajhrcqk6ejatdt/ANv-uIw78Q9hvbUzp5FEWHM?rlkey=8apdv9cwzptivbjaat39uwcfp&st=9esvs2et), and run it
   
   ```bash
   Obsidian_Milvus_Installer_AMD64.exe
   ```

3. 🚨 GPU not detected issue even though my GPU exists and supports CUDA
- If you do not have a CUDA supported GPU, you may skip this step
- Pytorch has two different versions. One is for CPU and the other is for GPU. Make sure you have the correct version installed. 
- If you arn't sure, follow the instruction below:
  - Install [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
  - Run the following commands:
  
    ```bash
    pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio -y
    conda create -n pytorch-gpu python=3.11 -y
    conda activate pytorch-gpu
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch:', torch.__version__); print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
    ```

### Manual Installation

1. Make sure git is installed
   
2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayjeo/obsidian-milvus-FastMCP
   cd obsidian-milvus-fastmcp
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   - Install conda([anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download))
   - Do the following:

    ```bash
    Open Anaconda Prompt with administrator privileges
    cd to your directory
    pip uninstall -y numpy sentence-transformers
    pip install "numpy>2.0.0"
    pip install --no-deps transformers==4.52.3
    pip install sentence-transformers==4.1.0 tqdm filelock fsspec
    pip install PyPDF2 markdown beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv watchdog psutil colorama pyyaml tqdm requests pymilvus mcp fastmcp torch
    ```

    - Sentence Transformers Library (sentence-transformers): The v3.1.1 release announced in September 2024 removed the numpy<2 constraint that was previously set to prevent conflicts in Windows environments on GitHub. This means that the latest version (≥3.1.1) of Sentence Transformers officially supports NumPy 2.x, allowing users to freely choose between NumPy 1.x and 2.x.
    - In conclusion, the paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2 model provided through the Sentence Transformers framework can operate normally in NumPy 2.x environments. This model is implemented based on Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, and as mentioned earlier, the combination of the latest Sentence Transformers version and PyTorch 2.5.1 has resolved compatibility issues with NumPy 2.x.
    - In fact, since the Sentence Transformers library officially supports NumPy 2.x on GitHub, and PyTorch 2.5.1 was also built to accommodate NumPy 2.x on GitHub, embedding extraction and other operations during model inference proceed without any additional errors. No differences based on NumPy version have been reported in either CPU environments or CUDA (GPU) accelerated environments, and since NumPy 2.x itself only affects CPU operations, CUDA usage is irrelevant to compatibility.
    - However, one thing to note is that the official requirements of the Hugging Face Transformers package still point to NumPy 1.x, which may cause warnings or conflicts during pip installation on GitHub. For example, when installing transformers via pip while NumPy 2.x is already installed, dependency conflict warnings may appear. However, this is merely an installation constraint and does not mean that the paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2 model malfunctions due to NumPy 2.x at runtime. The model itself operates normally with the latest compatible library combinations, and there are no reports of embedding quality or accuracy changing based on NumPy version.
    - The dependency warnings/conflicts that occur when installing Hugging Face Transformers via pip can be bypassed. First, if you attempt pip install transformers while maintaining NumPy 2.x, warnings will appear, but you can skip dependency checks using the `--no-deps` option.


1. **Install Podman**
   - From CMD: winget install RedHat.Podman
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run (Enable Virtual Machine)

     ```powershell
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```

   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run (Linux kernel update package)

     ```powershell
     wsl.exe --install
     ```

   - Set WSL 2 as your default version

     ```powershell
     wsl --set-default-version 2
     ```

   - Install your Linux distribution of choice
     - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
     - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
     - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
     - and so on
   - Restart after setting up WSL Linux system
   - `pip install podman-compose` using CMD at your path

2. **Configure paths**
   - Edit `config.py` and set your Obsidian vault path
   - Edit `config.py` and set your podman path
     - Find podman path using `find_podman_path.bat`

3. **Initialize Podman Container**

   ```
   complete-podman-reset.bat
   ```

4. **Initialize Milvus Server**

   ```
   start_mcp_with_encoding_fix.bat
   ```   

5. **Podman auto launch at startup**
   - Follow instructions in [Podman auto launch.md](https://share.note.sx/r6kx06pj#78CIGnxLJYkJG+ZrQKYQhU35gtl+nKa47ZllwEyfUE0)
   - When Windows starts, nothing will pop up unless there is an error
     - If you want to figure out the error, see `podman_startup.log`

6.  **Milvus Server auto launch at startup**
   - Follow instructions in [Milvus auto launch.md](https://share.note.sx/y9vrzgj6#zr1aL4s1WFBK/A4WvqvkP6ETVMC4sKcAwbqAt4NyZhk)

     - If you want to figure out the error, see `auto_startup_mcp.log` and `vbs_startup.log`
     - Launching the server takes approximately 5~7 minites depending on your PC performance. Wait for it to finish before you start Claude Desktop
   - A manual execution alternative is available, though this method proves operationally cumbersome
     - `run-main.bat`, and select option 1
     - You have to keep this CMD opened. Otherwise, the server will be terminated

## Use Project feature in Claude Desktop for better search results
- For example, I use a project called "obsidian" to search my Obsidian vault. 
- My project instructions are as follows. 
  - Use only information from the obsidian assistant MCP
  - For general searches, always use the auto_search_mode_decision function
  - Tell me how many md or pdf files were searched and provide the list
  - Summarize the content comprehensively
  - Only save md files to obsidian when specifically requested
  - If saving, the location should be G:\jayjeo
  - When saving, create the note list in a clickable format for obsidian
  - Create a list of referenced md and pdf files in clickable obsidian format at the top of the note

## Use Filesystem MCP to save markdown notes to Obsidian
  - This MCP is amazingly helpful for saving and reading any files in your system. 
  - This includes saving markdown notes to your Obsidian vault

## 🔴 **EMERGENCY RESET**

**If you encounter container conflicts or system issues**, you can use the emergency reset script:

```bash
complete-reset.bat  # Windows
```

🔴 **CRITICAL WARNING**: This script will:
- **Kill ALL Podman containers** (not just Milvus)
- **Remove ALL Podman containers, pods, volumes, and networks**
- **Delete local MilvusData and volumes directories**
- **Permanently destroy all container data system-wide**

🔴 **Use ONLY if**
- You have container name conflicts
- Milvus services fail to start properly
- You need a complete clean state
- **You don't have other important Podman containers running**

**Before running**: Make sure you don't have other Podman projects running that you want to preserve. This reset affects the **entire Podman system**, not just this project.



## 🎯 Claude Desktop Integration

- Claude Desktop configuration for this program is as follows. 
- However, this should be already set automatically by using `run-setup.bat` (option 5).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian-assistant": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
