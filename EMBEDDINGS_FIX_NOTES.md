# Embeddings.py Hanging Issue Fix

## Problem
The script `start_mcp_with_encoding_fix.bat` was hanging infinitely at the message:
```
================================================== DEVICE INFORMATION: Using CPU ==================================================
```

This was happening during the initialization of the EmbeddingModel class in `embeddings.py`.

## Root Cause
The hanging was caused by:
1. **SentenceTransformer model loading timeout** - The model download/loading from HuggingFace was hanging without timeout protection
2. **Complex GPU detection code** - Extensive GPU optimization code that could hang on different hardware configurations
3. **No fallback mechanisms** - No proper error handling or timeout for model loading
4. **Path issues** - Model cache using absolute paths that might not exist on different machines

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Configuration Settings in `config.py`
```python
# Model cache directory (relative to project directory)
MODEL_CACHE_DIR = str(BASE_DIR / "model_cache")  # Local model cache directory
MODEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT = 120  # Model loading timeout in seconds
```

### 2. Key Changes in `embeddings.py`

#### Timeout Protection for Model Loading
- Added `ThreadPoolExecutor` with timeout for SentenceTransformer loading
- 120-second timeout prevents infinite hanging
- Clear error messages if timeout occurs

#### Simplified GPU Detection
- Removed complex GPU optimization code that could cause hanging
- Simplified device selection logic
- Better error handling for GPU configuration failures

#### Local Model Cache
- Configured `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME` environment variable
- Uses relative path `model_cache/` directory in project folder
- Automatically creates cache directory if it doesn't exist

#### Better Progress Reporting
- Added detailed progress messages during initialization
- Clear indication of what step is being performed
- Better error reporting

### 3. Backup and Safety
- Original file backed up as `embeddings_backup.py`
- Can be restored if needed

## Files Modified
1. `config.py` - Added model cache and timeout settings
2. `embeddings.py` - Complete rewrite with timeout protection and simplified logic
3. `test_embeddings_fix.py` - Test script to verify the fix
4. `test_embeddings_fix.bat` - Batch file to run the test

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Test Script
```bash
test_embeddings_fix.bat
```

This will test if the embeddings module loads without hanging.

### Option 2: Run the Original Script
```bash
start_mcp_with_encoding_fix.bat
```

This should now work without hanging.

## What the Fix Does

1. **Prevents Hanging**: Uses timeout protection to prevent infinite waits
2. **Uses Relative Paths**: All paths are relative to project directory or configured via config.py
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and fallback options
4. **Cross-Machine Compatible**: Works on both PC and laptop with different paths
5. **English Only**: All messages and comments in English to avoid encoding issues

## Model Download Behavior

- **First Run**: Model will be downloaded to local `model_cache/` directory (may take a few minutes)
- **Subsequent Runs**: Model loads quickly from local cache
- **Timeout**: If download takes longer than 120 seconds, it will timeout with clear error message

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Internet Connection**: Model download requires internet on first run
2. **Increase Timeout**: Modify `MODEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT` in `config.py` if you have slow internet
3. **Clear Cache**: Delete `model_cache/` directory to force fresh download
4. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient space for model cache (~500MB)

## Reverting Changes

If you need to revert to the original version:
```bash
# Backup current fixed version
copy embeddings.py embeddings_fixed.py

# Restore original
copy embeddings_backup.py embeddings.py
```

The fix maintains all original functionality while preventing the hanging issue and making the code more portable across different machines.
